Description: Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames,
    so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise processed
    with tools like 'dplyr', 'tidyr' and 'ggplot2'. The package provides three
    S3 generics: tidy, which summarizes a model's statistical findings such as
    coefficients of a regression; augment, which adds columns to the original
    data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance, which
    provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
