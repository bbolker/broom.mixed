Description: Convert fitted objects from various R mixed-model
    packages into tidy data frames along the lines of the 'broom' package.
    The package provides three S3 generics for each model: tidy(), which
    summarizes a model's statistical findings such as coefficients of a
    regression; augment(), which adds columns to the original data such as
    predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance(), which
    provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
