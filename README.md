This package is a spin-off from the [broom package](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom) for tidying output of statistical models; it imports basic functionality from `broom` and implements particular methods to handle a wide class of mixed (hierarchical, multi-level) models.

## Where to ask questions

- for questions about mixed models and data analysis:
    - the [r-sig-mixed-models mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mixed-models) (please [subscribe to the list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mixed-models) before posting) or 
	- [CrossValidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com)  
The mailing list has more people who know about using mixed models in R; CrossValidated has a larger overall audience and a nicer question/answer format (allows pictures, code formatting, etc.).
- for questions about `broom.mixed` usage:
    - `r-sig-mixed-models@r-project.org` or 
	- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)  
	(similar pros/cons as the previous point)
- for bug, infelicity, and wishlist reporting: the [broom.mixed issues list](https://github.com/bbolker/broom.mixed/issues)
- maintainer e-mail only for urgent/private communications

Please do **not** cross-post, i.e. ask the same question in more than one forum, unless it's suggested that you have posted in the wrong place, or unless you receive total silence in one forum. In the latter case it may be better to send a reminder/"bump" message to the original forum; in any case you should mention in your new message where/when you've previously asked the question.
